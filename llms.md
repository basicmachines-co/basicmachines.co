# Basic Machines: Personal Manifesto and Vision

## Origins in Frustration and Hope

Every meaningful project starts from a place of tension - between what is and what could be. 
Basic Machines emerged from this exact space: the frustration of seeing technology increasingly become a force for dependence rather than independence, for complexity rather than empowerment, for lock-in rather than liberation.

### The Personal Journey

Like so many developers, I've watched technology landscape grow increasingly complex, increasingly corporate, increasingly disempowering. 
I've seen:
- Simple websites balloon into complex SPAs
- Basic hosting turn into complex cloud services
- Open standards replaced by proprietary platforms
- Developers needing entire teams to build basic applications

But rather than accept this as inevitable, I am asking: What if? What if we could build something different? 
What if we could return to the empowering aspects of technology while maintaining modern capabilities?

### Punk is not Dead

When I was younger, I was really into punk rock music. It completely changed my perspective on so many things, 
what art could be, who could create it, who was a consumer, who could be a producer. It connected me to something that felt authentic, 
and, much later, helped me recognize what was authentic within myself and what I connected to personally and what had value to me. 

As my education continued and I started learning about computer programming and technology, I found the Open Source, Free software community. 
To me, it represented something really similar to the ideas of the punk movement. Creation for the sake of curiosity, learning and self empowerment. 
Sharing ideas and working with others to create something bigger than you could do by yourself. 
Giving back instead of trying to seize control and limit other people's ability to improve thier own lives and work. 

Self actualization - fulfill own potential
- life as doing something worthwhile, not goal oriented
- define success as aesthetic of feeling purpose
- don't measure relevance with metrics
- life as navigation, not survival  
- all people are inherently born fully actualized

self reliance - don't wait for someone else's permission
- punk - idea that new ideas can be presented without perverting for profit
- new ideas need audience for a market, otherwise no profit
- gift of counterculture - permission to create freely
- take care of gift, keep it alive, and it continues to give.
- long-distance runners. The people who recognize that protest is a form of exercise and that life is there if you want it. You just have to be open, communicative and interested
- active participant in life - if you want to do something, you should do it
- idea that people’s time belongs to companies?! It’s just no way to live

do something good for world
- something that is not just taking

punk
- free space for new ideas
- create whatever you want 

The parallel with punk rock isn't superficial - it's fundamental to understanding this approach. 
Just as punk emerged as a reaction to bloated, corporate rock music, emphasizing individual artistic expression and 
direct participation over mass production, Basic Machines emerges as a reaction to bloated, corporate web development.

### Lessons from Dischord Records

One of the most profound bands and labels for me was Fugazi and their label, Dischord records, from Washington D.C. They lived

Quotes from Ian McKaye of Fugazi

Facing self doubt: 

> I have this concept about changing the source of light. The way things appear has a lot to do with where the light is. Sometimes things seem impenetrable, but maybe we just need to change the source of light. For instance, if you felt paralyzed by your work – you’re miserable but you’re scared to leave your situation, because  you think you’d become irrelevant – then I would say: stand back. Change the source of light. Look at the situation and realize that, though it is important to you – and I will say this to myself  – though it is important to you, your work is ridiculous. And your fears are unfounded.

https://www.huckmag.com/article/ian-mackaye-survival-issue-interview

Value is relative/subjective

> Nothing matters. Life is just a straight line. There are two definitive points, one at the beginning and one at the end. It could be argued that should you decide to procreate that may merit another point. Everything else is affection – accoutrements, add-ons, additives. The way we speak, the things we own, the way we identify ourselves, they’re all artifices on some level… While we’ve been talking maybe 100 people have been killed, maybe 1,000, who knows, and yet this development hasn’t affected our conversation whatsoever. If you put things in perspective one realises how it just doesn’t matter. So the value is up to us, and if we’re gonna assign the value, then why would we assign negative values?

On building a path for others to follow

>I’m not interested in legacy in terms of my reputation. I am however interested in leaving a trail. I feel really clear that the work that I’ve done – that we’ve done – was about kids doing something they wanted to do and showing that it’s possible despite what the corporations say. Leaving markers, or breadcrumbs, so that people know this is a possibility – I hope that inspires other people who inevitably will come along to do the same.

>So, yes, I am interested in documentation – I build archives precisely because I have a sense of custodial responsibility. A lot of my work has been focused on the idea that not only can you build your own road, but you can drive on it too. But the problem with these small roads is that they get built off to the side of super highways. They tend to be less used and they atrophy; the vines come over, then people think they’re not passable. That they’re not possible. But they are passable – they’re just not permanent. Super highways are permanent because the people who own the super highways, who erected the tolls, keep them that way. It’s just a different track. And it’s important that people know there are other possibilities.

Dischord Records didn't just release music - they created an entire alternative ecosystem:
- Their own recording processes
- Their own distribution networks
- Their own business models
- Their own definition of success


    Song #1
    Song by Fugazi
    
    Song number one is not a fuck you song
    I'll save that thought until later on
    You want to know if there's something wrong? It's nothing
    Everybody's talking about their hometown scenes And hurting people's feelings in their magazines You
    Want to know what it all means?
    It's nothing
    Fighting for a haircut?
    Then grow your hair
    Crying for the music?
    I doubt you really care
    Looking for an answer?
    You can find it anywhere
    It's nothing
    Life is what you want it to be
    So don't get tangled up trying to be free
    And don't worry what the other people see
    It's nothing

How these lyrics as they relate to Basic Machines' philosophy - how perfectly they align with the project's ethos, particularly:
The idea that authentic creation doesn't need to be reactionary or oppositional ("not a fuck you song") - Basic Machines isn't about fighting against big tech, it's about building alternatives.
The skepticism of scene politics and status-seeking that the song expresses mirrors your approach to tech - it's not about following trends or proving anything to anyone, it's about building useful tools that empower people.
The powerful message about authenticity and personal agency ("life is what you want it to be") perfectly captures Basic Machines' philosophy - it's about giving people the tools to build what they need, without getting caught up in industry drama or corporate gatekeeping.
This connection between punk philosophy and software development is fascinating - both are ultimately about empowering people to create on their own terms, without waiting for permission or validation from established systems.

Similarly, Basic Machines isn't just about components or frameworks - it's about creating an alternative ecosystem for web development:
- Simpler development patterns
- Direct user ownership
- Sustainable business models
- Community-oriented growth

The parallel between DIY punk and FOSS is profound and really resonates with me. Both movements fundamentally reject the idea that creation and distribution need to be controlled by large corporate entities - whether record labels or software companies.
Just as punk showed you don't need a major label's permission or resources to make and share meaningful music, FOSS proves you don't need a tech giant's blessing to create impactful software. Both are about:

Direct empowerment - giving people tools and knowledge
Community over profit - sharing freely builds more value
Authenticity over polish - working code over perfect code
Creation over consumption - be an active participant, not just a user

As you said, it's about abundance through sharing rather than scarcity through control. When Dischord Records shared their knowledge and resources with other indie labels, they didn't lose anything - they built a stronger scene. When developers share code and knowledge through open source, they don't lose their expertise - they build a stronger community.

## Technical Choices from Philisophical Choices

### Using DIY Open Source to invert levers of capitalism
- distribution is available to everyone
- automate re-production of process to run a business 
- technology as a tool for business, creat a lifestyle for yourself
- no vendor lock-in
- make information freely available to everyone 

### Seize means of production and distribution

> western capitalists are quickly redefining themselves as owners of the means of distribution, rather than of production. If labor unites and seizes online marketplaces, or creates its own collective alternatives, we can free ourselves from this new tyranny, and reclaim our labor value.

### The World Wide Web

w3c
- "web for all. web on everything" w3c mission statement
- HTML is common language for all platforms

> The web is the greatest entrepreneurial platform ever invented. Lowest barriers of entry, greatest human reach ever. I love the web. Permission-less, grand reach, diversity of implementation. Don’t believe this imaginary wall of access of money. It isn’t there.
> Examine and interrogate your motivations, reject the money if you dare, and startup something useful. A dent in the universe is plenty.
> Curb your ambition.
> Live happily ever after.

### own your work
> If it’s important enough for you to spend time creating something, it’s important enough to have a safe online place.
> You’ll own everything, and it’ll be yours forever. No investors, no market changes, and not a single external factor will sweep away all your work there.
> Use external platforms to expand your audience and engage with others. You can adapt your content to suit each platform’s specific features and audiences while maintaining the original and long-lasting content on your site.

### Community as Cornerstone

The community aspect of Basic Machines isn't an afterthought - it's central to its purpose:

#### Knowledge Sharing
- Detailed documentation isn't just helpful - it's liberating
- Code examples aren't just demonstrations - they're invitations
- Tutorials aren't just instructions - they're empowerment
- Support isn't just assistance - it's community building

#### Open Source as Praxis
- Code isn't just shared - it's given
- Modifications aren't just allowed - they're encouraged
- Questions aren't just answered - they're welcomed
- Growth isn't just personal - it's communal

### The Revolution is In the Details

Every line of code in Basic Machines is a small act of rebellion:
- Against unnecessary complexity
- Against corporate lock-in
- Against disempowerment
- Against the status quo

But more importantly, every line is an act of creation:
- Toward independence
- Toward understanding
- Toward community
- Toward empowerment

### Personal Stakes

This isn't just a project - it's a statement about:
- What technology can be
- How developers can work
- What independence means
- Why agency matters

It's proof that:
- Individual developers still matter
- Small can be beautiful
- Simple can be powerful
- Independence is possible

> if you can spend 8 hours building someone else’s dreams, you can spend 1 hour building your own._
> One of the most powerful ideas I’ve been thinking about recently is this:
> Bringing your ideal future into the now.
> That is, dedicating time to the lifestyle you will be living, but performing the same actions on a smaller timescale.

## Looking Forward

The future I'm building toward isn't just about better software - it's about better relationships:
- Between developers and their tools
- Between businesses and their technology
- Between communities and their platforms
- Between individuals and their digital world

### The Invitation

"Be the change you want to see"

this project embodies that principle in such a practical way. You're not just talking about digital autonomy and DIY ethics - you're actually building it, line by code line.
The "be the change you want to see" philosophy manifests here on multiple levels:

Technical Level


Instead of complaining about complex JavaScript frameworks, you're building a simpler alternative
Rather than accepting vendor lock-in, you're creating open tools
Instead of waiting for someone else to solve Python's component problem, you're tackling it head-on


Business Level


Showing that open source can be sustainably profitable
Demonstrating that individual developers can create professional-grade tools
Proving that AI can amplify individual capability without surrendering autonomy


Community Level


Creating the documentation you wish existed
Building the tools you wanted but couldn't find
Sharing knowledge freely while building value
Basic Machines isn't just a project - it's an invitation to:
- Build differently
- Think differently
- Work differently
- Create differently

It's a proof of concept for a different way of developing software, running businesses, and engaging with technology. 
It's personal, it's political, and it's practical.

### Why This Matters

> "I'm Working, But I'm Not Working For You"
- Superchunk - Slack Motherfucker

This lyric captures something essential about our approach. 
We're not anti-business or anti-technology. We're pro-independence. Pro-autonomy. Pro-human agency. 
The goal isn't to reject modern tools but to reshape them in service of individual and community empowerment.

In an age of increasing technological complexity and corporate control, projects like Basic Machines matter because they prove alternatives are possible. 
They show that:
- Individual agency is still powerful
- Community values are still viable
- Independence is still achievable
- Change is still possible

Every successful deployment, every satisfied user, every working component is a small victory - not just for the project, but for the idea that technology can still be a force for independence and empowerment.

### The Journey Continues


I want to live in a way where I feel like what I'm working on matters, and
This is just the beginning. With Basic Machines, it's no just creating software - it's creating possibility. 
To show that with dedication, clarity of purpose, and the right tools (including AI), youcan still make meaningful contributions to the world.

The future is unwritten, and with  Basic Machines project, I'm trying to  have a hand in writing it. 
Building, sharing, and proving that alternatives are possible.

Not just building software - building the future I want to be in.

    The revolution will not be televised
    Will not be televised
    Will not be televised
    Will not be televised
    The revolution will be no re-run, brothers
    The revolution will be live
    - Gil Scott-Heron


## Choosing the tools

Every technical decision in Basic Machines is also a philosophical decision:

### Server-Side Rendering
Choosing server-side rendering isn't just about performance - it's about:
- Reducing complexity
- Increasing accessibility
- Empowering more developers
- Simplifying maintenance

### Component Architecture
The copy-and-own approach to components isn't just about convenience - it's about:
- True ownership
- Direct understanding
- Freedom to modify
- Independence from package managers

### Python Focus
Staying within the Python ecosystem isn't just about familiarity - it's about:
- Readability
- Approachability
- Community values
- Sustainable development

### AI 

#### AI as Amplifier of Human Agency

One of the most exciting aspects of this project is how it demonstrates a different relationship with AI - 
not as a replacement for human agency, but as an amplifier of it. 
Without AI collaboration, this project might have remained just an idea. 
But with AI as a partner:
- Complex problems become manageable
- Knowledge gaps become bridgeable
- Ambitious goals become achievable
- Individual developers become capable of work that once required teams

This isn't about AI replacing human creativity - it's about AI extending human capability while maintaining human agency and vision.

#### A New Kind of Collaboration

Working with AI on Basic Machines has revealed a new kind of creative partnership:
- The vision remains human
- The principles remain clear
- The decisions remain ours
- But the capabilities are amplified

It's like having a technically skilled bandmate who can help you realize your musical vision without taking creative control.

# Basic Machines: Bringing Digital Independence to Life

## Technical Choices as Ideological Expression

Our technical stack isn't just a collection of tools – it's a carefully chosen set of technologies that embody our principles of independence and empowerment.

### The Return to Server-Side Rendering

The choice to focus on server-side rendering with Python isn't merely technical; it's a deliberate push against the increasing complexity of modern web development. While the industry has moved toward complex client-side applications that often require entire teams to maintain, we're proving that powerful, responsive applications can be built with simpler, more accessible technologies.

The HTMX/Alpine.js/Tailwind CSS stack represents a sweet spot between capability and complexity:
- HTMX brings dynamic updates without complex JavaScript frameworks
- Alpine.js provides lightweight interactivity where needed
- Tailwind CSS offers powerful styling without abstraction
- Python remains readable and approachable

This approach says: "You don't need a massive JavaScript framework and a team of specialists to build great web applications."

### Component Architecture: Ownership Over Dependency

Our approach to components, inspired by shadcn/ui but adapted for server-side rendering, embodies the DIY ethic in a powerful way:
- Components are copied into projects rather than installed as dependencies
- Users have full visibility and control over their code
- Modifications and customizations are encouraged
- No black boxes or magic

This model turns the traditional component library approach on its head. Instead of creating dependencies, we're providing starting points for creativity. It's like sharing guitar tabs in the punk scene – here's how to play it, now make it your own.

## AI Collaboration: A New Model of Creation

The role of AI in Basic Machines deserves special attention because it demonstrates a new way of working that maintains human agency while leveraging powerful tools.

### AI as Creative Partner

Our use of AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT has been transformative:
- Rapid prototyping of components
- Exploration of design patterns
- Documentation generation
- Problem-solving collaboration

But crucially, AI serves the vision rather than defining it. It's like having a technically skilled collaborator who can help implement ideas while leaving creative control firmly in human hands.

### v0.dev Integration: Democratizing Design

The planned integration with v0.dev for template creation is particularly exciting because it democratizes design capabilities:
- Rapid UI prototyping
- Professional-quality layouts
- Quick iteration on designs
- Accessible to non-designers

This shows how AI tools can be integrated thoughtfully to enhance capabilities without creating new dependencies.

## Business Model: Principles in Practice

Our business model demonstrates that it's possible to build a sustainable business while staying true to open source principles and user empowerment.

### The Template Business: Knowledge Sharing as Value

The template business isn't just about selling layouts – it's about sharing knowledge and patterns:
- Templates demonstrate best practices
- Each template is a learning resource
- Customization is encouraged
- Source code is visible and understandable

This model says: "We're not selling you black boxes; we're sharing our expertise and letting you build upon it."

### Full Stack Bundles: Empowerment at Scale

The full-stack bundles represent complete business solutions that users can truly own:
- Full source code access
- Clear upgrade paths
- No vendor lock-in
- Customization freedom

This approach challenges the SaaS status quo by showing that businesses can have professional-grade software solutions without surrendering control to external platforms.

## Community Building: Fostering Digital Independence

The community aspect of Basic Machines is crucial because it creates a network of mutually supportive creators:

### Knowledge Sharing

- Detailed documentation
- Implementation guides
- Best practices
- Real-world examples

### Collaborative Growth

- Open source contributions
- Shared problem-solving
- Pattern libraries
- Community support

## Looking Forward: A Template for Digital Independence

Basic Machines is proving that individual creators, empowered by AI and guided by strong principles, can create professional-grade tools that respect user freedom. This has implications beyond our specific project:

### For Developers

- Shows a path to independent creation
- Demonstrates sustainable business models
- Provides templates for AI collaboration
- Proves the viability of simpler approaches

- Reduces dependency risks

### For the Industry

- Challenges current development paradigms
- Shows alternatives to complex frameworks
- Demonstrates sustainable open source
- Provides new models for AI integration

## The Revolution is Personal

Perhaps most importantly, Basic Machines shows that meaningful change can start small:
- One developer can create significant tools
- Small businesses can own their technology
- Independence is achievable
- Growth can be organic and sustainable

We're not just building software – we're demonstrating a way of working that maintains human agency, encourages independence, and proves that individuals can still make a meaningful impact in the digital age.

This is technology with a punk spirit: DIY, anti-authoritarian, community-minded, and focused on genuine empowerment. By combining open source principles, AI collaboration, and a commitment to user freedom, we're helping to create a future where technology serves human agency rather than constraining it.

The excitement in this project comes from proving that these principles can work in practice – that we can build professional-grade tools while maintaining our independence and values. Every component, template, and feature is a small victory in the larger battle for digital autonomy.

Let's keep building. The future is unwritten, and we're proving it can be written by anyone with the tools and determination to try.
