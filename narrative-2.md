# Part I: Origins and Personal Journey

You know how sometimes the most meaningful projects start from a place of tension? That point where you look at how things are and can't help but imagine how they could be different? That's exactly where Basic Machines came from. 

## The Spark: From Punk to Programming

Every meaningful project starts from a place of tension between what is and what could be. For me, that tension began to form years ago in what might seem like an unlikely place: the punk rock scene. It wasn't just about the music - though the energy and raw creativity were certainly part of it. What punk gave me was something far more fundamental: the understanding that creating something meaningful doesn't require anyone's permission.

Punk showed me there was a different way to think about art, about who gets to be a creator versus just a consumer. More than anything, it connected me to something that felt authentic, and helped me recognize what was authentic within myself. There was a different way to think about creativity and ownership. It wasn't about how technically proficient you were or whether you were popular or had lots of money and financial backing - it was about having something authentic to express and the courage to express it. 

Ian MacKaye, whose work with Fugazi and Dischord Records deeply influenced my thinking, captured this perspective perfectly when he said:

> I have this concept about changing the source of light. The way things appear has a lot to do with where the light is. Sometimes things seem impenetrable, but maybe we just need to change the source of light. For instance, if you felt paralyzed by your work – you're miserable but you're scared to leave your situation, because you think you'd become irrelevant – then I would say: stand back. Change the source of light.

This idea of changing how we look at things, of finding new perspectives - it became really important as I started learning about computer programming and technology.

## Recognizing the Patterns

As I began exploring computer programming and technology, I started seeing a lot of parallels between ideas from the punk scene and the open source software community. Just as punk bands would share their music, methods, and ideas freely, contributing to a larger creative community, open source developers were sharing code, knowledge, and tools. Both were about creating for the sake of curiosity and learning. Both were about sharing ideas and working with others to build something bigger than what you could do alone. Most importantly, both were about giving back instead of trying to control and limit what others could do. They understood that sharing resources doesn't diminish their value - it multiplies it.

Just like punk showed you didn't need a major label's permission or resources to make and share meaningful music, I started seeing how open source proved you didn't need a tech giant's blessing to create impactful software.

## The Power of Free Software

The parallels between punk and open source run even deeper when you look at Free Software (FOSS) specifically. Just as punk bands would share their recordings through tape trading networks, building community through the act of sharing, Free Software creates value through mandatory sharing and reciprocity. The genius of the GPL license, for instance, isn't just that it makes software free - it's that it ensures improvements must be shared back with the community.

This creates a fundamentally different kind of value than proprietary software. When I modify or improve FOSS software, I'm not just creating value for myself - I'm contributing to a growing commons that everyone can build upon. It's like what happened when punk bands would share their DIY techniques for booking shows, recording albums, or screen-printing merchandise. Each shared piece of knowledge didn't diminish in value through sharing - instead, it grew as others adapted and improved upon it.

MacKaye captured this perspective when he talked about community building:

> So, yes, I am interested in documentation – I build archives precisely because I have a sense of custodial responsibility. A lot of my work has been focused on the idea that not only can you build your own road, but you can drive on it too. But the problem with these small roads is that they get built off to the side of super highways. They tend to be less used and they atrophy; the vines come over, then people think they're not passable. That they're not possible. But they are passable – they're just not permanent.

This perfectly describes the FOSS approach - it's not just about creating software, it's about documenting and sharing our paths so others can follow and extend them. Each contribution becomes part of a growing body of knowledge and tools that remains permanently available to the community, even as technology evolves and changes.


## The Growing Tension

But as I continued my work and involvement in technology, I began to notice a troubling trend. The web, which started as an open platform for sharing information and empowering creativity and innovation, was becoming increasingly complex and corporatized. Simple websites were growing into massive single-page applications. Basic hosting services were morphing into labyrinthine cloud platforms. Individual sites were being replaced by massive walled platforms. It has become increasingly complicated to build technology. What once took a single developer now required entire teams.

It felt like we were losing sight of what technology was supposed to be about - empowering people to create and share ideas. Instead of making things simpler and more accessible, we were adding layers of complexity and corporate control. The parallels to the music industry were hard to miss - the same forces that punk had originally rebelled against were now emerging in the digital world.

## The Natural Cycle of Innovation

This is where another insight from Ian MacKaye became relevant. He observed how movements start as rebellion, get absorbed into the mainstream, grow too big, and eventually break apart under their own weight, making space for new beginnings. I started seeing this pattern everywhere in technology:
- HTML started as simple markup, grew into complex frameworks, and now we're seeing a return to simpler approaches
- JavaScript began as a basic scripting language, exploded into massive frameworks, and now there's a movement back toward minimal JavaScript
- Corporate controlled platforms went from a service for users to turning their own users into a product and monetizing their attention, eventually becoming hostile to end uers and enshittifying [1]

> how enshittification works. It’s a three-stage process: first, platforms are good to their users. Then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers. Finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, there is a fourth stage: they die.

The observation about punk's evolution perfectly captures a universal pattern we see everywhere - in music, in technology, in culture. Things start simple and pure, grow complex as they're adopted, eventually become unwieldy, working against the interests they were originally intended to serve, and then break apart, allowing the cycle to begin again.

## The Search for Authenticity

In technology work, just as in music, authenticity comes from creating something that aligns with your values and serves a real purpose. For me, this meant finding a way to build software that embodied the principles I believed in: simplicity, ownership, and empowerment. 

That's when I started asking "what if?" What if we could build something different? What if we could return to those empowering aspects of technology while keeping the genuine advances we've made? What if we could create tools that actually help people own and understand their technology instead of just renting access to black boxes they can't control, or settling for platforms that are trying to take advantage of them?

## Creating Meaningful Alternatives

> "Song #1": "Life is what you want it to be / So don't get tangled up trying to be free / And don't worry what the other people see / It's nothing" 
- Fugazi

This gets to the heart of what Basic Machines is about. It's not about fighting against any system - it's about building an alternative. Something that embodies the values of both punk DIY culture and open source software: independence, community, and authentic creation.

The goal isn't to create something permanent or unchangeable, but to show what's possible and leave a trail for others to follow. Disschord Records didn't just release music but created an entire ecosystem - their own recording processes, distribution networks, and business models. Similarly, Basic Machines aims to provide fundamental building blocks that developers can truly understand, control, and combine in their own ways.

## The Name: More Than Just a Name

The name "Basic Machines" itself came from an unexpected source: my university textbook on the theory of computation where I learned about how complex computational systems could be built by combining simple Turing machines - these fundamental building blocks called "Basic Machines."

In computer science theory, these basic machines come in two types: symbol-writing and head-moving. They're incredibly simple on their own, but when combined thoughtfully, they can perform any computation imaginable. What struck me about this was how it paralleled other ideas I was passionate about: in punk music, where three chords could create powerful songs. Then, as as simple Turing machines could be combined to create any computation, perhaps we could create software tools that were both simple and powerful.

## The Philosophy in the Machine

This idea - that complex systems can be built from simple, understandable parts - becomes really powerful when you apply it to modern software development. Just like those theoretical Turing machines that could be "borrowed in toto from previous constructions," we can create software that's both powerful and comprehensible by combining well-understood components.

The academic text describes how "the construction of complicated machines will be facilitated, since sizable submachines can be borrowed in toto from previous constructions." This is exactly what we're doing with Basic Machines - creating fundamental building blocks that developers can understand, control, and combine in their own ways.

## Connecting Theory to Practice

What's beautiful about this connection is how it bridges theoretical elegance with practical empowerment:

This is why I chose the name "Basic Machines" for this project. It's about:
- Creating fundamental building blocks that people can truly understand
- Empowering developers to build complex systems from simple parts
- Maintaining control and ownership over the technology we use
- Sharing knowledge in a way that builds community

## Where Theory Meets DIY

The parallel between theoretical computer science and DIY culture might seem unexpected, but they're both about understanding systems from their foundations up. Just as punk said "here are three chords, now form a band," basic Turing machines say "here are simple operations, now compute anything." And that's exactly what we're saying with Basic Machines: "here are the fundamental tools, now build your digital future."

## The Power of Basic Elements

This is where the "basic" in Basic Machines takes on multiple meanings:
1. Like basic Turing machines, it's about fundamental building blocks
2. Like basic punk rock, it's about stripping away unnecessary complexity and how powerful expression can come from basic elements
3. Like basic source code, it's about having a foundation that can be forked, modified, and recombined, built from understandable pieces

The beauty of source code and open source is that it enables this natural evolution. When something becomes too complex or strays from its original purpose, anyone can fork it, strip it back to its essentials, and start fresh. This is exactly what happened with:
- Linux as a simplification of Unix
- Git as a simplification of version control
- React as a simplification of web UI (and now perhaps we're seeing the next cycle with simpler approaches)
- Huge wall platforms splintering into smaller, newer ones

## Source Code as Cultural Evolution

Combining these perspectives, you can see that the way source code is built, using revisions, branches, and forks is particularly apt. It's like musical evolution:
- A basic chord progression spawns countless songs
- Those songs influence new musicians
- Those musicians create their own variations
- The cycle continues, with each iteration building on what came before

In the same way, Basic Machines aims to provide those fundamental patterns that others can take, modify, and evolve. It's not about creating a fixed solution, but about enabling continuous evolution and adaptation.

## Breaking Apart to Rebuild

The insight about things breaking apart under their own weight isn't a tragedy - it's a feature. It's nature's way of maintaining balance and enabling renewal. In software terms:
- When frameworks become too complex, developers start looking for simpler solutions
- When platforms become too controlling, communities build alternatives
- When systems become too opaque, transparency becomes valuable again

## Basic Machines as Part of the Cycle

This positions Basic Machines not just as a project, but as part of this natural cycle:
- It's a response to the current complexity in web development
- It's a return to fundamental principles of ownership and understanding
- It's building blocks that others can take and recombine
- It's accepting that what we build might itself evolve, break apart, and be reborn in new forms

The goal isn't to fight this cycle but to work with it - to create something that's:
- Simple enough to be understood
- Flexible enough to be recombined
- Open enough to be forked
- Basic enough to serve as a foundation for the next cycle

## Seeing the Patterns

When you start recognizing patterns, they show up everywhere. Just as I saw the DIY ethos of punk reflected in open source, I began to see this cycle of creation, complexity, and renewal playing out in technology. Ian MacKaye put it perfectly when talking about punk - how movements start as rebellion, get absorbed into the mainstream, grow too big, and eventually break apart under their own weight, making space for new beginnings.

## The Current Landscape

Looking at today's tech landscape, I see this pattern clearly:
- Simple websites have become complex SPAs
- Basic hosting has morphed into intricate cloud services
- Open standards have been replaced by proprietary platforms
- What used to take one developer now needs entire teams

But here's the thing - this isn't necessarily bad news. When things get too big and complex, they naturally start to break apart. We're seeing signs of this everywhere:
- Developers yearning for simpler solutions
- The return to server-side rendering
- Growing frustration with framework complexity
- Increasing concern about vendor lock-in

## The Open Source Connection

This is where open source becomes so important. Like the way punk bands would share their music and methods freely, open source provides the foundation for renewal. It gives us:
- The ability to fork and simplify
- The freedom to experiment and recombine
- The power to start fresh when needed
- The means to share our solutions with others

Looking at successful open source projects, you often see this pattern:
1. They start as simple solutions to real problems
2. They grow and gain adoption
3. They sometimes become complex
4. New, simpler alternatives emerge, often built on their foundations

## Where Basic Machines Fits

This connects back to the punk idea of building alternative ways of expression: it's not about creating something permanent or unchangeable, but about showing what's possible and leaving a trail for others to follow. And you can use that new idea you've created to drive new ideas forward. 

Basic Machines emerges from recognizing these patterns and consciously choosing to participate in this cycle of renewal and re-creation. Like those basic Turing machines that can be combined to create more complex computations, we're creating fundamental building blocks that:
- Start simple and understandable
- Can be combined and recombined
- Remain under user control
- Enable natural evolution

It's not about fighting complexity - it's about providing the tools for evolution when complexity becomes overwhelming. Just as punk showed that you don't need complex musical training to create meaningful music, Basic Machines shows that you don't need massive frameworks and teams to build useful software.
