# Origins and Personal Journey

You know how sometimes the most meaningful projects start from a place of tension? That point where you look at how things are and can't help but imagine how they could be different? That's exactly where Basic Machines came from. 

## Finding My Way Through Music

When I was younger, punk rock completely changed how I saw the world. It wasn't just about the music - it was about this radical idea that you didn't need anyone's permission to create something meaningful. Punk showed me there was a different way to think about art, about who gets to be a creator versus just a consumer. More than anything, it connected me to something that felt authentic, and helped me recognize what was authentic within myself.

There's this great quote from Ian MacKaye that really captures what I'm talking about:

> I have this concept about changing the source of light. The way things appear has a lot to do with where the light is. Sometimes things seem impenetrable, but maybe we just need to change the source of light. For instance, if you felt paralyzed by your work – you're miserable but you're scared to leave your situation, because you think you'd become irrelevant – then I would say: stand back. Change the source of light.

This idea of changing how we look at things, of finding new perspectives - it became really important as I started learning about computer programming and technology.

## From Punk to Programming

Here's where things get interesting - as I got deeper into the tech world, I started seeing these amazing parallels between the punk scene and the open source/free software community. Both were about creating for the sake of curiosity and learning. Both were about sharing ideas and working with others to build something bigger than what you could do alone. Most importantly, both were about giving back instead of trying to control and limit what others could do.

Just like punk showed you didn't need a major label's permission or resources to make and share meaningful music, I started seeing how open source proved you didn't need a tech giant's blessing to create impactful software.

## The Tension Point

But here's where the tension comes in. Over the years, I've watched the tech landscape become increasingly:
- Complex (simple websites turning into massive SPAs)
- Corporate (basic hosting becoming complex cloud services)
- Disempowering (developers needing entire teams for basic applications)

It's like we've lost sight of what technology was supposed to be about - empowering people to create and share ideas. Instead of making things simpler and more accessible, we keep adding layers of complexity and corporate control.

## The Spark

That's when I started asking "what if?" What if we could build something different? What if we could return to those empowering aspects of technology while keeping the genuine advances we've made? What if we could create tools that actually help people own and understand their technology instead of just renting access to black boxes they can't control?

Basic Machines isn't just a reaction to these problems - it's an attempt to build an alternative. Like that Fugazi song "Song #1" says:
"Life is what you want it to be / So don't get tangled up trying to be free"

It's not about fighting against the current system - it's about building something better. Something that embodies the values of both punk DIY culture and open source software: independence, community, and authentic creation.

# Origins and Intellectual Foundations

## The Name: More Than Just a Name

The name "Basic Machines" has a deeper meaning that connects theoretical computer science with DIY philosophy. It comes from my university days studying "Elements of the Theory of Computation," where I learned about how complex computational systems could be built by combining simple Turing machines - these fundamental building blocks called "Basic Machines."

In theoretical computer science, these basic machines come in two types: symbol-writing and head-moving. They're incredibly simple on their own, but when combined thoughtfully, they can perform any computation imaginable. What struck me about this was how it paralleled other ideas I was passionate about: in punk music, where three chords could create powerful songs, and in open source, where simple tools could be combined to build complex systems.

## The Philosophy in the Machine

This idea - that complex systems can be built from simple, understandable parts - becomes really powerful when you apply it to modern software development. Just like those theoretical Turing machines that could be "borrowed in toto from previous constructions," we can create software that's both powerful and comprehensible by combining well-understood components.

The academic text describes how "the construction of complicated machines will be facilitated, since sizable submachines can be borrowed in toto from previous constructions." This is exactly what we're doing with Basic Machines - creating fundamental building blocks that developers can understand, control, and combine in their own ways.

## Connecting Theory to Practice

What's beautiful about this connection is how it bridges theoretical elegance with practical empowerment:

1. In theoretical computer science, it shows how universal computation can emerge from simple parts
2. In punk music, it demonstrates how powerful expression can come from basic elements
3. In open source software, it proves how complex systems can be built from understandable pieces

This is why I chose the name "Basic Machines" for this project. It's about:
- Creating fundamental building blocks that people can truly understand
- Empowering developers to build complex systems from simple parts
- Maintaining control and ownership over the technology we use
- Sharing knowledge in a way that builds community

## Where Theory Meets DIY

The parallel between theoretical computer science and DIY culture might seem unexpected, but they're both about understanding systems from their foundations up. Just as punk said "here are three chords, now form a band," basic Turing machines say "here are simple operations, now compute anything." And that's exactly what we're saying with Basic Machines: "here are the fundamental tools, now build your digital future."

## The Natural Cycle of Innovation

Ian MacKaye's observation about punk's evolution perfectly captures a universal pattern we see everywhere - in music, in technology, in culture. Things start simple and pure, grow complex as they're adopted, eventually become unwieldy, and then break apart, allowing the cycle to begin again.

In technology, we see this pattern constantly:
- HTML started as simple markup, grew into complex frameworks, and now we're seeing a return to simpler approaches
- JavaScript began as a basic scripting language, exploded into massive frameworks, and now there's a movement back toward minimal JavaScript
- Even Unix followed this pattern: "small is beautiful" to complex systems, and back to containerization and microservices

## The Power of Basic Elements

This is where the "basic" in Basic Machines takes on multiple meanings:
1. Like basic Turing machines, it's about fundamental building blocks
2. Like basic punk rock, it's about stripping away unnecessary complexity
3. Like basic source code, it's about having a foundation that can be forked, modified, and recombined

The beauty of source code and open source is that it enables this natural evolution. When something becomes too complex or strays from its original purpose, anyone can fork it, strip it back to its essentials, and start fresh. This is exactly what happened with:
- Linux as a simplification of Unix
- Git as a simplification of version control
- React as a simplification of web UI (and now perhaps we're seeing the next cycle with simpler approaches)

## Breaking Apart to Rebuild

The insight about things breaking apart under their own weight isn't a tragedy - it's a feature. It's nature's way of maintaining balance and enabling renewal. In software terms:
- When frameworks become too complex, developers start looking for simpler solutions
- When platforms become too controlling, communities build alternatives
- When systems become too opaque, transparency becomes valuable again

## Basic Machines as Part of the Cycle

This positions Basic Machines not just as a project, but as part of this natural cycle:
- It's a response to the current complexity in web development
- It's a return to fundamental principles of ownership and understanding
- It's building blocks that others can take and recombine
- It's accepting that what we build might itself evolve, break apart, and be reborn in new forms

The goal isn't to fight this cycle but to work with it - to create something that's:
- Simple enough to be understood
- Flexible enough to be recombined
- Open enough to be forked
- Basic enough to serve as a foundation for the next cycle

This connects back to the punk ethos: it's not about creating something permanent or unchangeable, but about showing what's possible and leaving a trail for others to follow. As MacKaye said about his work: "I'm not interested in legacy in terms of my reputation. I am however interested in leaving a trail."

## Source Code as Cultural Evolution

Your point about source code revisions, branches, and forks is particularly apt. It's like musical evolution:
- A basic chord progression spawns countless songs
- Those songs influence new musicians
- Those musicians create their own variations
- The cycle continues, with each iteration building on what came before

In the same way, Basic Machines aims to provide those fundamental patterns that others can take, modify, and evolve. It's not about creating a fixed solution, but about enabling continuous evolution and adaptation.


## Seeing the Patterns

When you start recognizing patterns, they show up everywhere. Just as I saw the DIY ethos of punk reflected in open source, I began to see this cycle of creation, complexity, and renewal playing out in technology. Ian MacKaye put it perfectly when talking about punk - how movements start as rebellion, get absorbed into the mainstream, grow too big, and eventually break apart under their own weight, making space for new beginnings.

## The Current Landscape

Looking at today's tech landscape, I see this pattern clearly:
- Simple websites have become complex SPAs
- Basic hosting has morphed into intricate cloud services
- Open standards have been replaced by proprietary platforms
- What used to take one developer now needs entire teams

But here's the thing - this isn't necessarily bad news. Just like in punk music, when things get too big and complex, they naturally start to break apart. We're seeing signs of this everywhere:
- Developers yearning for simpler solutions
- The return to server-side rendering
- Growing frustration with framework complexity
- Increasing concern about vendor lock-in

## The Open Source Connection

This is where open source becomes so important. Like the way punk bands would share their music and methods freely, open source provides the foundation for renewal. It gives us:
- The ability to fork and simplify
- The freedom to experiment and recombine
- The power to start fresh when needed
- The means to share our solutions with others

Looking at successful open source projects, you often see this pattern:
1. They start as simple solutions to real problems
2. They grow and gain adoption
3. They sometimes become complex
4. New, simpler alternatives emerge, often built on their foundations

## Where Basic Machines Fits

Basic Machines emerges from recognizing these patterns and consciously choosing to participate in this cycle of renewal. Like those basic Turing machines that can be combined to create more complex computations, we're creating fundamental building blocks that:
- Start simple and understandable
- Can be combined and recombined
- Remain under user control
- Enable natural evolution

It's not about fighting complexity - it's about providing the tools for renewal when complexity becomes overwhelming. Just as punk showed that you don't need complex musical training to create meaningful music, Basic Machines shows that you don't need massive frameworks and teams to build useful software.
